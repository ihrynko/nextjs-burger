        <p>
          There's fast food, and then there's us. We are driven by an urge to
          show that fast food can be made better. We take great care in quality
          and finding the right raw materials. This means that we can not only
          serve a meal that tastes better, but also feels better. Our
          restaurants must be a place where it is nice to be. Where it is cozy
          and where we want to make our guests feel welcome, seen, heard and
          pampered at all times. We want to be known for our friendliness,
          tenacity and the ability to think new things; we both can and will
          deliver - every time. The world and our guests are digital - and we
          make art after them. With style. We know that ease of use and
          involvement of the guests is a prerequisite for our success. That is
          why we are digital in a way that makes it easy for our guests to enjoy
          delicious food in a delicious setting. After all, technology, IT
          systems and digitization are all about making everything a little
          easier and a little faster than expected â€“ to the benefit of both
          guests and ourselves.
